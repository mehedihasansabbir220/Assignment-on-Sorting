# Assignment-on-Sorting

### Code Behavior
- Task 1: The function finds the kth largest element by partially sorting the array using the Quickselect algorithm.
- Task 2: The function merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array in place by starting from the end.
  
## Time and Space Complexity
1. Task 1:
- Time Complexity: Average case O(n), Worst case O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
2. Task 2:
- Time Complexity: O(m + n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
###  Proper Variable Names and Comments
- Variables are named descriptively (i, j, k, pivot, pivotIndex) for clarity.
- Comments are added for each function to explain its purpose and logic.
  
### Commits on Code
    Initial commit with the implementation of Task 1 and Task 2 with proper comments and variable names.
    Added README with instructions on how to run the code and explanations of the tasks.
    You can copy the above JavaScript code into a .js file and run it using Node.js or any JavaScript runtime environment.
